## DISCLAIMER:
This module was created **before June 27, 2022**. It may contain outdated code and compatibility issues. Please use with caution.

## Introduction:
The ImprovedMagnitude module revolutionizes hitbox calculations, offering enhanced accuracy and flexibility. It takes into account various properties, including the size of the enemy, to deliver precise results. 

### Why Use ImprovedMagnitude?
- Pinpoint Accuracy: Consider the size of the enemy when calculating hitboxes, ensuring you accurately hit your targets, even if they're colossal.
- Efficient Range Calculation: Specify a maximum distance and an ignore list to streamline hitbox calculations and exclude unwanted objects.

## Usage:

```lua
-- Import the ImprovedMagnitude module
local ImprovedMagnitude = require(script.ImprovedMagnitude)

-- Create a new instance of ImprovedMagnitude
local Hitbox = ImprovedMagnitude.new()

-- Set the properties of the hitbox
Hitbox.HitPoint = MyHumanoidRootPart.Position -- Center point for hitbox calculations
Hitbox.MaxDistance = 10 -- Maximum range

Hitbox.Directory = workspace.Players -- Enemies' Directory
Hitbox.IgnoreList = {MyCharacter}

-- Calculate the enhanced magnitude of the hitbox
local target = Hitbox:Get()
```
